## Project Scope

*This is my LaunchCode Apprenticeship Applicant capstone project; it's purpose is primarily to demonstrate my skills as a junior developer. It is my take on Lego collection tracking/creation idea sites like [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com) and [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page). This is a full-stack project, using Java on the back-end with Spring Boot/Gradle for dependency injection, Hibernate for the ORM database handling, and Spring Security for authentication. Front-end styling will be managed mainly with Bootstrap. The application will utilize the [Rebrickable API](https://rebrickable.com/api/) to source Lego set numbers; part names, sizes, and colors; MOCs(My Own Creations, a lego fanbase term for a user-designed Lego build); part category names; and set themes.

At present, only the most basic setup has been uploaded to GitHub; this will change as features are added and this portion of the read me will be updated as necessary.
